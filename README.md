# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
A binary classification ML project for Titanic dataset. 
The project used various supervised ML algorithms to predict the survivors of Titanic Disaster.
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, Logistic Regression and Suport Vector Machines.
Neural Network model turns to perform better in terms of predicting survivors of this disaster.
